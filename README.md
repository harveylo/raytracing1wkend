# Simple Ray Tracing Renderer
This project is based on the [book series](https://raytracing.github.io/).

All code has been copied and/or modified from the book. I have arranged it in a way that makes it more readable as a complete project.
# Multi-threads support
To configure the project, please modify the BATCH constant variable in util.hpp according to the number of physical cores on your machine.
